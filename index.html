          <div class="content">
            Foie gras is a popular and well-known delicacy in French cuisine. Its flavor is described as rich, buttery, and delicate, unlike that of an ordinary duck or goose liver. Foie gras is sold whole, or is prepared into mousse, parfait, or pâté, and may also be served as an accompaniment to another food item, such as steak.

          <div class="content">
            Blanquette de veau (veal stew) is the mother of all French dishes. Blanquette de veau is a French veal ragout in which neither the veal nor the butter is browned in the cooking process. To refrain from browning meat and fat in this way, is to cook them en blanquette. A classic dish of delicate veal, butter, cream and carrots.

          <div class="content">
            Choucroute is French for "sauerkraut." This stick-to-your-ribs dish is made with much enthusiasm in the northeastern French region of Alsace. Served with beer or the same wine used in the dish, choucroute satisfies the soul on a cold winter's night. Serve with good country-style rye bread and hot mustard for the sausage.
